clicraft.conf(5)
================

Name
----
clicraft.conf - clicraft server wrapper configuration file

Synopsis
--------
{CONFDIR}/clicraft.conf

Description
-----------
Configuration options for clicraft are stored in {CONFDIR}/clicraft.conf. The
format is bash, so configuration options take the form +OPTION="value"+ (with
no whitespace between the equals sign (`=`) ). This file is sourced from
within clicraft, so you can include any extra variables you wish to use in
custom action scripts. You can also embed shell logic without trouble; this
behavior may change in future versions, however.

An example default file is located at {CONFDIR}/clicraft-defaults.conf. It
is fairly well-commented, so it may be easiest to simply copy it to
{CONFDIR}/clicraft.conf and follow the directions inside for customization.

Options
-------
**SERVER_DIR=**"/path/to/server/directory"::
	The directory that the server is launched from.
	Clicraft switches to this directory before performing any action, so
	this is the directory that your world data, server.properties, and
	server.log (among other things) resides in. Most relative paths are taken
	ith respect to this directory.
+
Default: "{SERVER_DIR}"


**SERVER_NAME=**"name"::
	An identifier for the server. This is the value used to set tmux's
	window and session names when starting the server. It is also used in some
	informational messages.
+
Default: "minecraft"


**SERVER_JAR=**"/path/to/server/jar"::
	The location of the server jar on disk.
+
Default: "$SERVER_DIR/minecraft_server.jar" (but see +SERVER_TYPE+, below)


**SERVER_URL=**"url"::
	The url to download +SERVER_JAR+ from.
+
Default:
"https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/launcher/minecraft_server.jar"
(but see +SERVER_TYPE+, below)


**SERVER_TYPE=**"type"::
	If this option is set to "bukkit", +SERVER_JAR+ and +SERVER_URL+ will take on
	default values such that the server uses Bukkit Recommended Builds, instead
	of the vanilla minecraft jar. That is, they will have these default values:
+
-----
SERVER_JAR="$SERVER_DIR/craftbukkit.jar"
SERVER_URL="http://cbukk.it/craftbukkit.jar"
-----
+
Default: <empty>


**START_COMMAND=**"/path/to/command [options]"::
	The command that should be used to launch the server.
+
The shell expands this option twice, so care must be taken to protect
whitespace and special characters.
+
Default: "java -jar \'$SERVER_JAR' nogui"


**DOWNLOAD_COMMAND=**"/path/to/command [options]"::
	The command used to download or update the server jar. Running this
	command should result in +SERVER_URL+ being downloaded and saved to
	+SERVER_JAR+.
+
The shell expands this option twice, so care must be taken to protect
whitespace and special characters.
+
Default: "curl -#L -o $SERVER_JAR $SERVER_URL"
