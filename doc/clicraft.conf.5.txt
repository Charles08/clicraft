clicraft.conf(5)
================

Name
----
clicraft.conf - clicraft server wrapper configuration file

Synopsis
--------
$CONFDIR/clicraft.conf

Description
-----------
Clicraft's main configuration file is +clicraft.conf+, which is stored in one
of three directories. In order of preference:

* $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clicraft
* ~/.config/clicraft
* {CONFDIR}

Clicraft searches these directories and uses the first one it finds. That
directory is referred to as +$CONFDIR+. If +$CONFDIR+ is empty, clicraft
populates it with default config files from {CONFDIR}.

The format for +clicraft.conf+ is bash, so configuration options take the form
+OPTION="value"+ (with no whitespace between the equals sign (`=`) ).

This file is sourced from within clicraft before the default values are set,
so you must take care to initialize any options that another option depends
on. For example, if you set `SERVER_JAR=$SERVER_DIR/custom_server.jar` without
setting +SERVER_DIR+ first, clicraft will look for +/custom_server.jar+, which
is probably not what you want.

An example default file is located at +{CONFDIR}/clicraft-defaults.conf+. It
is fairly well-commented, so it may be easiest to simply copy it to
+$CONFDIR/clicraft.conf+ and follow the directions inside for customization.

Options
-------
In addition to the options listed below, +clicraft.conf+ can include any extra
variables you wish to use in custom action scripts.


**MULTIPLEXER=**"multiplexer"::
	The terminal multiplexer to use. Valid values are "tmux" and "screen".
+
*Default*: +"tmux"+


**SERVER_DIR=**"/path/to/server/directory"::
	The directory that the server is launched from.
	Clicraft switches to this directory before performing any action, so
	this is the directory that your world data, server.properties, and
	server log (among other things) resides in. Most relative paths are taken
	with respect to this directory.
+
*Default*: +"{SERVER_DIR}"+


**SERVER_NAME=**"name"::
	An identifier for the server. This is the value used to set the multiplexer's
	window and session names when starting the server. It is also used in some
	informational messages.
+
*Default*: +"minecraft"+


**SERVER_JAR=**"/path/to/server/jar"::
	The location of the server jar on disk.
+
*Default*: +"$SERVER_DIR/minecraft_server.jar"+ (but see +SERVER_TYPE+, below)


**SERVER_URL=**"url"::
	The url to download +SERVER_JAR+ from.
+
*Default*:
+"https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/%v/minecraft_server.%v.jar"+
(but see +SERVER_TYPE+, below)


**SERVER_LOG=**"/path/to/server.log"::
	The location of the server log file
+
*Default*: +"$SERVER_DIR/logs/latest.log"+


**SERVER_VERSION=**"version"::
	The server version. This will replace any instances of +%v+ in
	+DOWNLOAD_COMMAND+. If set to "release" or "snapshot", the latest
	Minecraft release or snapshot version will be substituted instead.
+
*Default*: +"release"+


**SERVER_TYPE=**"type"::
	The minecraft implementation this server uses. Valid values are
	"minecraft" and "bukkit".
+
For convenience, if this option is set to "bukkit", +SERVER_JAR+ and
+SERVER_URL+ will take on default values such that the server uses Bukkit
Recommended Builds, instead of the vanilla minecraft jar. That is, they will
have these default values:
+
-----
SERVER_JAR="$SERVER_DIR/craftbukkit.jar"
SERVER_URL="http://cbukk.it/craftbukkit.jar"
-----
+
*Default*: +"minecraft"+


**START_COMMAND=**"/path/to/command [options]"::
	The command that should be used to launch the server.
+
The shell expands this option twice, so care must be taken to protect
whitespace and special characters.
+
*Default*: +"java -jar $SERVER_JAR nogui"+


**STOP_CMD=**"cmd"::
	The command to send to the server console to shut the server down.
+
*Default*: +"stop"+


**DOWNLOAD_COMMAND=**"/path/to/command [options]"::
	The command used to download or update the server jar. Running this
	command should result in +SERVER_URL+ being downloaded and saved to
	+SERVER_JAR+.
+
The shell expands this option twice, so care must be taken to protect
whitespace and special characters.
+
*Default*: +"curl -#L -o $SERVER_JAR $SERVER_URL"+


**TIMEOUT=**"seconds"::
	The amount of time, in seconds, that clicraft will wait for critical
	operations to finish.
+
*Default*: +"20"+


**START_TIMEOUT=**"seconds"::
	The amount of time, in seconds, that clicraft will wait for the server to
	start up.
+
*Default*: +$TIMEOUT+


**STOP_TIMEOUT=**"seconds"::
	The amount of time, in seconds, that clicraft will wait for the server to
	shut down.
+
*Default*: +$TIMEOUT+


**CMD_TIMEOUT=**"seconds"::
	The amount of time, in seconds, that clicraft will wait for a command to
	finish when using `clicraft cmd`.
+
*Default*: +$TIMEOUT+


**CMD_LSTRIP=**"string"::
	The string to strip from the beginning of commands passed to `clicraft cmd`.
+
*Default*: +"/"+


**REDB=**"/path/to/regex/database.tab"::
	The location of the regex database. Each line of this file should consist
	of a key followed by a space followed by an extended regular expression.
	Any occurences of a slash (+/+) in the regular expression should be
	escaped with a backslash (+\+).
+
In addition, a regular expression which begins with two start-of-line anchors
(+\^\^+) may have special meaning. Typically, this sequence of characters will
be replaced with +^'timestamp'+, where 'timestamp' is the value of the
timestamp database entry.
+
*Default*: +"$CONFDIR/redb/$SERVER_TYPE.tab"+
