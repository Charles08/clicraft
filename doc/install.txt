Clicraft Install Guide
======================

WARNING: This is alpha software. Use at your own risk!

Requirements
------------
There are several things you need to build and run clicraft.
These dependencies are described below.

The versions and implementations of tools described in this section are known
to work with clicraft. If you have these requirements and are unable to build
or run clicraft, please file a link:{BUG}[bug report]. If you successfully
build and run clicraft with a different or older set of tools, I'd love to
hear about it so I can update this document.

Build Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build clicraft from source, you need the following:

* A reasonably compliant shell

In order to build the documentation, you will also need this optional
dependency:

* link:http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] version 8.8.6 or greater

Runtime Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clicraft needs these programs in order to successfully run:

Quick Install
-------------
The procedure for installing from source, briefly, is

	./configure && make && make install

If a <<package,package for your distribution>> is available, you should
probably use that instead. If no package is available for your system and you
are unable to create one, you may want to read the detailed instructions below
for <<source,installing from source>>.

Install
-------

[[package]]
From A Package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Installing from a package with your distribution's package manager is the
recommended and preferred way of installing clicraft. Listed below are the
distributions that packages are available for.

*Arch Linux* (pacman pkg)::
	Several `PKGBUILD` scripts are available in the
	link:http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?O=0&K=clicraft&do_Search=Go[AUR].
	Instructions for creating pacman packages from a `PKGBUILD` using
	`makepkg` can be found on
	link:https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR[this ArchWiki page].

*Debian, Ubuntu* (dpkg/apt deb)::
	A .deb package of the latest version should be available on the GitHub
	link:https://github.com/DMBuce/clicraft/downloads[downloads page].
	You can install it with +dpkg -i clicraft_*_all.deb+.

*RHEL, CentOS* (yum/rpm)::
	Clicraft is currently not available in rpm format, but it just so happens
	that the developer knows how to write spec files for building rpms. If you
	are interested in installing clicraft on a RHEL-based distribution, please
	file a feature request, and I'll do my best to accomodate you.

*Other Distributions*::
	If your distribution is not listed above, a package is unfortunately not
	available for you. If are willing and able to package clicraft for your
	distribution, patches for including your build script in the clicraft
	source repository are most welcome. Otherwise, you'll most likely have to
	<<source,install from source>>.

[[source]]
From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: Commands in this section are preceded with a `$` if they should be run
as a regular unprivileged user, or `#` if they should be run as root

The current clicraft codebase can be fetched with

	$ git clone git://github.com/DMBuce/clicraft.git

In order to build from a specific branch, you can use

	$ git checkout branch

To build a specific version, you can use

	$ git checkout version

or link:https://github.com/DMBuce/clicraft/tags[download]
the zip or tarball from GitHub and extract it into a directory named
+clicraft+. If you don't know what branch or version to use, you can safely
ignore the previous two commands.

For the rest of these instructions, you'll need to switch directories into the
source distribution.

	$ cd clicraft

Next, you'll need to generate a `configure` script. This is easily
accomplished with

	$ autoconf

At this point, you could install clicraft with these three commands

	$ ./configure
	$ make
	# make install

You may, however, want to read the output of `./configure --help` in order to
set appropriate paths and options for your system. You may also want to make
use of the +DESTDIR+ make variable in order to perform a staged install. The
procedure for using these features is described for several common scenarios
below.

[[user]]
User installation under $HOME
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To install clicraft as a regular user, you should choose an empty directory
under +$HOME+ that you have write access to.

In this example, I have chosen to install clicraft to the `$HOME/clicraft`
directory. If that directory does not exist, you can create it using

	$ mkdir $HOME/clicraft

Then, you can configure clicraft to be installed to that directory using

	$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/clicraft \
		--sysconfdir=$HOME/clicraft/etc \
		--libexecdir=$HOME/clicraft/lib \
		--localstatedir=$HOME/clicraft/srv \
		--enable-shortdirs

Finally, you can install clicraft with

	$ make && make install

Install as an Admin to /usr/local
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

WARNING: Installing clicraft using this method is not recommended. In most
circumstances, installing <<user,as a user>> or <<package,with your
package manager>> is the preferred procedure.

If you are an administrator with root privileges, you can choose to install
clicraft to the system. In most linux distributions, +/usr/local+ is reserved
for software installed by the administrator, so it is recommended you install
clicraft to this directory. The rest of this section assumes that this is the
directory where you are installing to.

As a regular, unprivileged user (NOT root), run

	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local \
		--sysconfdir=/usr/local/etc \
		--libexecdir=/usr/local/lib \
		--localstatedir=/var/local

Clicraft's Makefile supports the `DESTDIR` make variable, so you can stage the
installation. To do this, choose a staging directory that you have write
access to. In this example, I have chosen `/tmp/staging`. If that directory
does not exist, you can create it using

	$ mkdir /tmp/staging

Then, you can stage clicraft for installation. As a regular, unprivileged user
(NOT root), run

	$ make && make DESTDIR=/tmp/staging install

Now, you can inspect the contents of `/tmp/staging` for sanity. Note that at
this time, the clicraft executable won't actually work. Once you are
satisfied, you can copy the contents of this directory to your system in order
to complete the installation. As root, run something like the following

	# cp -R /tmp/staging/* /usr/local

Configuration
-------------

At this point, clicraft should be installed and working. If it is, you can get
basic usage info by running `clicraft help`. For information on clicraft usage
and configuration, refer to the linkman:clicraft[1] and
linkman:clicraft.conf[5] man pages.
