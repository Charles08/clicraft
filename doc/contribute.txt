Coding Conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When developing against clicraft, try to follow established coding
conventions. In particular:

. Quote variables whenever possible.
. Use tabs for indentation and spaces for formatting.
. Use extended bash conditionals (`[[ ... ]]`), not posix-style test commands
(`[ ... ]`).
. Don't use the `[[ ... ]] && command` or `[[ ... ]] || command` constructs.
Expand them to full `if` statements.
. When opening new code blocks for +while+, +if+, or +for+ loops, place the
subsequent +do+ or +then+ on the same line.
+
-----
for i in {1..5}; do
	echo "$i"
done

if [[ -f "$file" ]]; then
	cat "$file"
fi

-----
+
. When declaring functions, use parenthesis instead of the +function+ keyword and put the
opening brace on the same line as the function declaration.

-----
msg() {
	local mesg=$1
	shift

	printf -- "${mesg}\n" "$@"
}
