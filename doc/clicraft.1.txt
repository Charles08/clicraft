Name
----
clicraft - command-line minecraft server wrapper

Synopsis
--------
'clicraft' [options] <action> [args]

Description
-----------
Clicraft is a command-line wrapper for operation and administration of a
minecraft-compatible server. It is written in linkman:bash[1] and uses
linkman:tmux[1] or linkman:screen[1] to daemonize and communicate with the
server process.

The 'action' is an action to perform on the server, such as starting it,
stopping it, or sending a command to the server console. Actions are
implemented with action scripts, which can be provided by the clicraft package
or written by the user. For more information on writing action scripts, see
linkman:clicraft-actions[5]. The actions that ship with a default clicraft
install are described below.

Options
-------

*-c*, *--config*=<config>::
	Use 'config' as the configuration directory. For other methods of setting
	this directory, see linkman:clicraft.conf[5].

*-x*, *--xtrace*::
	Print all expanded bash commands run by 'action' to stdout. This is
	accomplished by
	setting bash's +xtrace+ option, and is mainly useful for debugging actions
	scripts. See linkman:clicraft-actions[5] for more information on action
	scripts.
+
If this option is passed multiple times, +xtrace+ is set as soon as the second
option is encountered, which can be useful for debugging clicraft itself.

*-h*, *--help*::
	Display this help message and exit.

*-V*, *--version*::
	Output version information and exit.

Actions
-------

*cmd* [-v|--verbose] [-q|--quiet] <command>::
	Sends 'command' to the server console. If clicraft recognizes 'command',
	it will wait until the command finishes or +CMD_TIMEOUT+ seconds, whichever
	comes first, before returning. Any leading occurences of +CMD_LSTRIP+ are
	removed from the beginning of 'command' before being sent to the server
	console.
+
With +-v+ or +--verbose+, print +SERVER_LOG+ to stdout. If clicraft recognizes
the command, it will attempt to print until the command finishes. Otherwise,
it will print for +CMD_TIMEOUT+ seconds.
+
With +-q+ or +--quiet+, suppress +-v+ output.
+
See linkman:clicraft.conf[5] for a description of the +CMD_TIMEOUT+,
+CMD_LSTRIP+, or +SERVER_LOG+ options.

*console*::
	Attach to the server console. This places you in the multiplexer shell
	session that the server is running in. All normal multiplexer key-bindings
	(like `Ctrl-b d` or `Ctrl-a d` to detach) should work.

*dl* [version]::
	Downloads version 'version' of the server jar file. If 'version' is
	+release+ or +snapshot+, the latest release or snapshot version is used.
	If no 'version' is supplied on the command line, use `SERVER_VERSION`
	instead.
+
The jar file is downloaded from `SERVER_URL` and saved to location
`SERVER_JAR` using `DOWNLOAD_COMMAND`. Any instances of the string +%v+ in
`DOWNLOAD_COMMAND` are substituted with 'version'.
+
If `SERVER_JAR` already
exists, it is backed up to `SERVER_JAR.ccback` before being overwritten, and
restored from `SERVER_JAR.ccback` if the download fails.
+
For information regarding `SERVER_VERSION`, `SERVER_URL`, `SERVER_JAR`, and
`DOWNLOAD_COMMAND`. see linkman:clicraft.conf[5].

*edit* [file|action]::
	Without 'file' or 'action', edit clicraft.conf. If 'file' exists in the
	server directory, edit it. If vinbt is installed, 'file' has a +.dat+
	extension, and it exists in the world directory, edit 'file' with vinbt.
	Otherwise, edit the action script for 'action'. If the script does not
	already exist, create it with one of these templates:
+
* +$CLICRAFT_CONFIG/action.d/'action'.sh.example+
* +$CLICRAFT_CONFIG/action.d/action.sh.example+
* +$CLICRAFT_CONFIG/action.d/action-override.sh.example+

+
See linkman:clicraft.conf[5] for a description of +$CLICRAFT_CONFIG+.
+
If the file is empty after editing, clicraft will delete it.
+
This command launches +EDITOR+ to edit files, or linkman:vi[1] if the +EDITOR+
variable is not defined in your environment.

*enable* [options] <action> [name]::
	Enables one of the example actions documented in
	linkman:clicraft-examples[1]. If 'name' is given, the new action script is
	enabled with that name.
+
Command line options:
+
*-c, --copy*:::
	Copy the example action script. This ensures any local
	changes you make to the script are not overwritten when upgrading clicraft.
+
*-s, --symlink*:::
	Symlink the example action script. This is the default, and ensures that
	changes in functionality are reflected in the enabled script when
	upgrading clicraft.

*disable* <action>::
	Disables an 'action' script created by the user.

*help* [action]::
	Displays usage information for 'action'. If no 'action' is given, clicraft
	usage is displayed instead.

*redb* [operation] [args]::
	Manipulate the regex database. Exact usage depends on 'operation':
+
*redb* lookup <key>:::
	Prints the regex for 'key' from the regex database. If a regex for 'key'
	does not exist, returns a nonzero exit status.
+
*redb* insert <key> <value>:::
	Inserts a new 'key' and 'value' into the regex database. If a regex for
	'key' already exists, returns a nonzero exit status.
+
*redb* update <key> <value>:::
	Changes the regex for 'key' to 'value' in the regex database. If a regex
	for 'key' does not exist, returns a nonzero exit status.
+
*redb* delete <key>:::
	Deletes the regex for 'key' from the regex database. If a regex for 'key'
	does not exist, returns a nonzero exit status.

+
If no 'operation' or 'args' are supplied, they are read from stdin.

*restart* [-w|--warn]::
	Restarts the server. With +--warn+, clicraft broadcasts a message in chat
	for 15 seconds to warn players that the server is being restarted.

*start*::
	Starts the server.

*status*::
	Reports on whether the server is running or not. If the server
	is not running, returns a nonzero exit status.

*stop*::
	Stops the server.

*version*::
	Prints version information.

Examples
--------

clicraft cmd save-off::
	Prepare for a backup by disabling writes to the world files.

clicraft cmd save-on::
	Re-enable writes to the world files.

clicraft edit server.properties::
	Edit the server properties file.

clicraft edit level.dat::
	Edit the server's level.dat file.

Configuration
-------------

See linkman:clicraft.conf[5] for details on configuring clicraft and
linkman:clicraft-actions[5] for writing custom action scripts.
