Name
----
clicraft - command-line minecraft server wrapper

Synopsis
--------
'clicraft' <action> [args]

Description
-----------
Clicraft is a command-line wrapper for operation and administration of a
minecraft-compatible server. It is written in linkman:bash[1] and uses
linkman:tmux[1] to daemonize and communicate with the server process.

The 'action' is an action to perform on the server, such as starting it,
stopping it, or sending a command to the server console. Actions are
implemented with action scripts, which can be provided by the clicraft package
or written by the user. For more information on writing action scripts, see
linkman:clicraft-actions[5]. The actions that ship with a typical clicraft
install are described below.

Actions
-------

*cmd* <command>::
	Sends 'command'
	to the server console. The command should not be preceded by a slash (`/`).
	For instance, to broadcast a message to logged-in users, you would use
	`clicraft cmd say Hello world`, not `clicraft cmd /say Hello world`

*console*::
	Attach to the server console. This places you in the linkman:tmux[1]
	session that the server is running in. All normal tmux keybindings (like
	`Ctrl-b d` to detach) should work.

*dl*::
	Downloads the server jar file. The jar file is downloaded from
	`SERVER_URL` and saved to location `SERVER_JAR`. If `SERVER_JAR` already
	exists, it is backed up to `SERVER_JAR.ccback` before being overwritten.
+
For information regarding `SERVER_URL` and `SERVER_JAR`, see
linkman:clicraft.conf[5].

*edit* [file|action]::
	Edit 'file' in the server directory.
+
If 'file' does not exist,
edit the action script for 'action' instead. When editing a new action or
overriding a system action, clicraft will create a new user action using one
of these templates:
+
* {CONFDIR}/action.d/action.sh.example
* {CONFDIR}/action.d/action-override.sh.example

+
When no 'file' or 'action' is present, edit linkman:clicraft.conf[5].
+
This usage of clicraft launches `EDITOR` to edit files, or linkman:vi[1] if
the `EDITOR` variable is not defined in your environment.

*explore* <size> [args]::
	Generates a rectangle of land of a given 'size' using
	linkman:mcexplore[1]. By default, 'size' is measured in chunks. Any
	additional 'args' get passed to `mcexplore` or `mcexplore.py`, which must
	be in your `PATH`. For valid 'args', see `mcexplore --help`.
+
Using this action is equivalent to running
+mcexplore -p SERVER_DIR -c START_COMMAND 'size' ['args']+.
For information regarding `SERVER_DIR` and `START_COMMAND`, see
linkman:clicraft.conf[5].
+
NOTE: This action is only available if clicraft was built using
`--with-mcexplore`.

*help* [action]::
	Displays usage information for 'action'. If no 'action' is given, clicraft
	usage is displayed instead.

*map* [args]::
	Maps the world using linkman:c10t[1]. Any additional 'args' get passed to
	`c10t`, which must be in your `PATH`. For valid 'args', see `c10t --help`.
+
With a default install of minecraft, using this action is equivalent to
running +c10t -w SERVER_DIR/'world' -o $HOME/maps/'world'-'date'.png ['args']+,
where +'date'+ is today's
date in YYYY-MM-DD format and +'world'+ is the value of +level-name+ in
+server.properties+. For information regarding `SERVER_DIR`, see
linkman:clicraft.conf[5]. If the `$HOME/maps` directory does not exist, it is
created.
+
NOTE: This action is only available if clicraft was built using `--with-c10t`.

*restart*::
	Restarts the server.

*start*::
	Starts the server.

*status*::
	Reports on whether the server is running or not. If the server
	is not running, returns a nonzero exit status.

*stop*::
	Stops the server.

*version*::
	Prints version information.

Examples
--------

clicraft cmd save-off::
	Prepare for a backup by disabling writes to the world files.

clicraft cmd save-on::
	Re-enable writes to the world files.

clicraft edit server.properties::
	Edit the server properties file.

clicraft explore 10 20 -x 500 -z 500::
	Generate a 160x320 region (10 by 20 chunks) centered on (x=500, z=500).

clicraft map -R 250 -r 270::
	Generate a map centered on spawn out to a radius of 250 chunks, and rotate
	it 270 degrees.

Configuration
-------------

See linkman:clicraft.conf[5] for details on configuring clicraft and
