==================

A command-line minecraft server wrapper.

WARNING: This is alpha software. Use at your own risk!

Overview
--------
Clicraft is a command-line wrapper for operation and administration of a
minecraft-compatible server. It is written in
http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[bash] and uses
http://tmux.sourceforge.net/[tmux] or
link:https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/[screen] to daemonize and communicate
with the server process.

Clicraft strives to be simple, robust, and useful. With it, you can:

* Manage (start, stop, update) a minecraft-compatible server from the command line
* Easily use third-party minecraft utilities (stop referring to `--help` output for basic options)
* Programmatically or interactively send commands to the server console
* Extend functionality by writing your own hooks called
