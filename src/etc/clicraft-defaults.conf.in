#!bash
# This is the default clicraft configuration file. The format is bash, so
# configuration options take the form OPTION="value" (with no whitespace
# between the equals sign (=) ).
#
# This file is sourced from within clicraft before the default values are set,
# so you must take care to initialize any options that another option depends
# on. For example, if you set SERVER_JAR=$SERVER_DIR/custom_server.jar without
# setting SERVER_DIR first, clicraft will look for /custom_server.jar, which
# is probably not what you want.
#
# You can include any extra variables you wish to use in custom action
# scripts here. You can also embed shell logic without trouble; this behavior may
# change in future versions, however.


# MULTIPLEXER
# The terminal multiplexer to use. Valid values are "tmux" and "screen".
#
MULTIPLEXER="tmux"


# SERVER_DIR
# The directory that the server is launched from.
# This is the directory that your world data, server.properties, and server log
# (among other things) resides in.
#
SERVER_DIR="@DEFAULT_SERVER_DIR@"


# SERVER_NAME
# An identifier for the server. This is the value used to set the multiplexer's
# window and session names when starting the server. It is also used in some
# informational messages.
#
SERVER_NAME="minecraft"


# SERVER_JAR, SERVER_URL
# The location of the server jar on disk and on the web, respectively
#
SERVER_JAR="$SERVER_DIR/minecraft_server.jar"

# SERVER_LOG
# The location of the server log file
#
SERVER_LOG="$SERVER_DIR/logs/latest.log"


# SERVER_VERSION
# The server version. This will replace any instances of '%v' in
# DOWNLOAD_COMMAND. If set to 'release' or 'snapshot', the latest release or
# snapshot version will be substituted instead.
#
SERVER_VERSION="release"


# SERVER_TYPE
# If this option is set to "bukkit", SERVER_JAR and SERVER_URL will take on
# default values such that the server uses Bukkit Recommended Builds, instead
# of the vanilla minecraft jar. That is, they will have these default values:
#SERVER_JAR="$SERVER_DIR/craftbukkit.jar"
#SERVER_URL="http://cbukk.it/craftbukkit.jar"

# STOP_CMD

# DOWNLOAD_COMMAND
# The command used to download or update the server jar. Running this
# command should result in SERVER_URL being downloaded and saved to
# SERVER_JAR.

# TIMEOUT
# The amount of time, in seconds, that clicraft will wait for certain internal
# operations to finish.
