#!bash
# This is the default clicraft configuration file. The format is bash, so
# configuration options take the form OPTION="value" (with no whitespace
# between the equals sign (=) ). This file is sourced from within clicraft,
# so you can include any extra variables you wish to use in custom action
# scripts. You can also embed shell logic without trouble; this behavior may
# change in future versions, however.


# SERVER_DIR
# The directory that the server is launched from.
# This is the directory that your world data, server.properties, and server.log
# (among other things) resides in.
#
# Default:
#SERVER_DIR="@DEFAULT_SERVER_DIR@"


# SERVER_NAME
# An identifier for the server. This is the value used to set tmux's
# window and session names when starting the server. It is also used in some
# informational messages.
#
# Default:
#SERVER_NAME="minecraft"


# SERVER_JAR, SERVER_URL
# The location of the server jar on disk and on the web, respectively
#
# Default:
#SERVER_JAR="$SERVER_DIR/minecraft_server.jar"
#SERVER_URL="https://s3.amazonaws.com/MinecraftDownload/launcher/minecraft_server.jar"


# SERVER_TYPE
# If this option is set to "bukkit", SERVER_JAR and SERVER_URL will take on
# default values such that the server uses Bukkit Recommended Builds, instead
# of the vanilla minecraft jar. That is, they will have these default values:
#SERVER_JAR="$SERVER_DIR/craftbukkit.jar"
#SERVER_URL="http://cbukk.it/craftbukkit.jar"
#
# Default:
#SERVER_TYPE=""


# START_COMMAND
# The command that should be used to launch the server.
#
# Default:
#START_COMMAND="java -jar '$SERVER_JAR' nogui"


# DOWNLOAD_COMMAND
# The command used to download or update the server jar. Running this
# command should result in SERVER_URL being downloaded and saved to
# SERVER_JAR.
#
# Default:
#DOWNLOAD_COMMAND="curl -#L -o $SERVER_JAR $SERVER_URL"
