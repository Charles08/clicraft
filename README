This is EXPERIMENTAL software. Use at your own risk!

clicraft is a command-line wrapper for operation and administration of a
Minecraft or Bukkit server. It is writtin in BASH, and uses tmux to daemonize
and communicate with the server process.

Features include:
   * Manage a minecraft or bukkit server from the command line
   * Ability to start and stop the minecraft server, download/update jar file
   * Attach to the server console to enter commands
   * Send commands to the server console from the command line
   * Extend functionality by writing your own hooks in etc/action.d/

See INSTALL for installation instructions, LICENSE for terms and conditions,
and TODO for planned features.

Once you've followed the procedure outlined in INSTALL, you should be able to
get usage info using

   clicraft help

To configure the server, copy the default config file found in $sysconfdir/clicraft/
to $sysconfdir/clicraft/clicraft.conf and edit to taste

   cp /etc/clicraft-defaults.conf /etc/clicraft.conf
   vim /etc/clicraft.conf
