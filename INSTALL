Warning: Do NOT install or run this program as root!

To install, create an installation directory (referred to by $CLICRAFT from
here on out) and copy the contents of src/ to that directory.

   CLICRAFT=~/clicraft
   mkdir $CLICRAFT
   cp -r src/* $CLICRAFT

It may be useful to put the clicraft executable somewhere in your PATH. There
are three ways to do this.

   1. Symlink the executable from a directory in your PATH:

         cd ~/bin
         ln -s $CLICRAFT/bin/clicraft

   2. Create a CLICRAFT environment variable and move clicraft into you PATH:

         export CLICRAFT=/full/path/to/clicraft
         echo "export CLICRAFT=$CLICRAFT" >>~/.bashrc
         mv $CLICRAFT/bin/clicraft /usr/local/bin/

   3. Set your path to include $CLICRAFT/bin

         export PATH="$PATH:$CLICRAFT/bin"
         echo 'export PATH="$PATH:'"$CLICRAFT"'/bin"' >>~/.bashrc

Once you've followed one of the instructions above, you should be able to
get usage info using

   clicraft help

To configure the server, copy the default config file found in $CLICRAFT/etc
to $CLICRAFT/etc/clicraft.conf and edit to taste

   cp $CLICRAFT/etc/clicraft-defaults.conf $CLICRAFT/etc/clicraft.conf
   vim $CLICRAFT/etc/clicraft.conf
